# InfraNodus Claude Skills Repository

This collection of skills is based on the [InfraNodus cognitive variability](https://infranodus.com/about/cognitive-variability) framework that is implemented in [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) text analysis tool.
Use the skills as extended prompts in Claude Web or in your favorite LLM client. They will augment the capacities of the model and help you introduce custom logic, frameworks, workflows, and guidelines into the model's behavior.

The skills are designed to work with each other and to hand off important tasks when needed. They are also integrated with the [InfraNodus MCP Server](https://github.com/infranodus/mcp-server-infranodus) tools, so you can use advanced text gap analysis, SEO optimization, and knowledge graph memory in your workflows.

## Skills Available

- **Writing Assistant** - Grammar correction, style refinement, and pattern detection that can trigger cognitive state analysis.
